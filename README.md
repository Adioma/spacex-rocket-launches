# Interactive version at Lviv Space Apps Hackathon (2018)

The infographic was significantly improved at [Lviv Space Apps NASA hackathon](https://2018.spaceappschallenge.org/challenges/can-you-build/when-next-rocket-launch/teams/rocketeers/members/) in 2018 thanks to [Anna Vital](https://github.com/annavital), [Mark Vital](https://github.com/markvital), [@dborchuk](https://github.com/dborchuk), [@ibitlab](https://github.com/ibitlab). It's based on [SpaceX launches data](https://github.com/r-spacex/SpaceX-API) maintained by reddit community.
